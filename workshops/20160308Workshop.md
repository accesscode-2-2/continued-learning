#Agenda:
1. HackerRank fundamentals in Obj C and Swift
2. Problem solving strategies for programming challenges (using HR and english)
3. Break into groups of 3 ppl and do HR challenges together in 15 minute chunks per problem
4. Back into a big group to discuss Cracking the Coding interview as a resource, and teach a bit of Java for understanding the solutions
